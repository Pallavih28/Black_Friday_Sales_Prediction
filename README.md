# 🛍️ Black Friday Sales Prediction Project

## 📝 Overview
This project aims to predict customer purchase amounts on Black Friday based on various demographic and transactional features. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to create an accurate model that can forecast purchase behavior and provide insights into consumer spending patterns during this significant retail event.

## ✨ Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted thorough EDA to understand the underlying patterns and distributions within the Black Friday sales dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the data, performed feature engineering, and handled missing values to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Selection:** Identified and selected relevant features for modeling based on their importance and correlation with the target variable.
- **Model Building:** Utilized advanced machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression to build predictive models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R-squared score, and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized model parameters using techniques like grid search and random search to improve predictive accuracy.
- **Deployment:** Deployed the trained model for real-time predictions, allowing for seamless integration with business applications or systems.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python (version X.X.X)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
